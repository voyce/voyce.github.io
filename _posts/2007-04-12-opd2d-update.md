title: OpD2d Update
---

I finally got around to building and packaging a new version of OpD2d. Major new features are:



	
  * Preview window so you can easily check volume levels before recording

	
  * Ability to pass recording settings on command line so you can use Windows Scheduler to record automatically at a certain time


It’s available here: [http://www.opcode.co.uk/opd2d/default.asp](http://www.opcode.co.uk/opd2d/default.asp)

OpD2d has been downloaded about 5000 times a month for the past few years, and I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the people who’ve been generous enough to paypal me a few quid as thanks. This is much appreciated, and helps to keep me in [t-shirts](http://www.i-manifest.com/).
