Well, I've done it: I've got my first game live on the AppStore. It's been an interesting journey. I'm terribly bad at getting my hands on devkits and SDKs, having a play with them and then not doing anything constructive. This dates way back to things like the Playstation NetYaroze, which was pretty expensive, and with which I failed to produce anything concrete. So this time around all the pieces were in place: shiny new "gaming" kit, interesting SDK, low cost of entry. I was determined to create!

I'll be making a series of posts on the process and details of creating it, in the interest of sharing the fun. In the meantime, you can find out more about the game [here](http://www.ianvoyce.com/BattleFingers).
