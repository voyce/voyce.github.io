After several years gestation, “Greedy Baby”, a DVD collaboration between my friend Bob Jaroc and electronica impresarios Plaid has finally been unleashed.


As well as enjoying the DVD, I’ve also been to many of the live shows - including at the London IMax -  and it’s impressive stuff. Forget the faux-psychedelic rave visuals you might have seen elsewhere, this is a truly mind-bending and intelligent aural-visual union.
