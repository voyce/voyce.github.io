Interesting to see the collapse of wedding gift company WrapIt all over the news:

I wrote the system behind their website, which, according to their (now-ex) technical director, was still in use verbatim 8 years after I did the original work! Pretty impressive, I reckon. If you're interested it was SQL server and ASP based, with a custom C++/COM business logic layer.

But obviously no matter how good the system, it doesn't matter if your business plan sucks...
