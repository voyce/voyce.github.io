Well, the title says it all really. I just wanted to let everyone know that I'm not dead - despite what you may be thinking based on my lack of blog output - it's just that I've been insanely busy on a project in the day job. Yep, it's that old excuse of real paying work getting in the way of the fun stuff again.

Hopefully soon I'll manage to post some new stuff, possibly more 'transitioning to F#' posts and bit more iOS development malarkey. In the meantime, keep on keeping on.
