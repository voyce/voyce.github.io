Next week I'm visiting Microsoft headquarters in Redmond to find out more about the new versions of Visual Studio and the .NET runtime. It's a chance to get some hands-on experience with the new WPF interface in VS2010 - although it's still only a beta build, so probably too early to make judgements on speed and responsiveness of the UI - and the new language features in C# 4. Importantly it's also a change to get a first look at F# as a first class language citizen within VS!

On a related note, if you're at all interested in programming languages and their implementation on the CLR, head over to here for the [Lang.net symposium](http://langnetsymposium.com/): "a forum for discussion on programming languages, managed execution environments, compilers, multi-language libraries, and integrated development environments". Videos of all the talks are being posted, albeit in Silverlight/WMV format.
