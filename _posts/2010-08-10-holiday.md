If you've been wondering where I've got to over the past few weeks, rest assured I've not given it all up, but I'm taking 6 weeks out to travel round the west coast of the USA with my family in an RV (a motorhome). If you need any more detail than that (really?), head over to [bigtrip.voyce.com](http://bigtrip.voyce.com).

See you back here in September!
