title: Too busy to blog...!?
---

Yes I know, shocking isn't it? Too busy doing work that pays the bills to blog about random things I find interesting or amusing. 

So what's been keeping me away from WordPress?




	
  * Spending too much time in WinDbg tracking down .NET and COM memory issues.

	
  * Wanting to have a good look at Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0 (though not as much as I'd like, yet)

	
  * Playing lots of [Bayonetta](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JTX5SO?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwvoycecom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002JTX5SO)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwvoycecom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002JTX5SO), and some [Heavy Rain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CZ38KA?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwvoycecom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002CZ38KA)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwvoycecom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002CZ38KA).

	
  * Doing lots of internal demos of the WPF\F# GUI-building toolset we've been working on. Should be interesting, specially now [Luca's coming on board](http://blogs.msdn.com/lucabol/archive/2010/02/19/luca-bolognese-leaves-microsoft.aspx).


  * Experimenting with iPad development




Hopefully I'll get the chance to write something about all of this soon.
