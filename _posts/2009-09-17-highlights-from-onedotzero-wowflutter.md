I took a trip down to London's Southbank on Sunday evening to see wow+flutter, a showcase of short, digitally-themed animations that are part of [onedotzero](http://www.onedotzero.com), an annual festival and tour celebrating "adventures in moving image". I've been several times before when it was based at the [ICA](http://www.ica.org.uk/) (it's now moved to the [BFI National Film Theatre](http://www.bfi.org.uk/whatson/bfi_southbank)), and I always find it really inspiring. Normally, I can never remember the details of the films I've seen - it's pretty intense; with over an hour of back-to-back shorts each lasting only 1-3 minutes - but this year they provided a list of the films details, so I can report on some of my highlights and provide links to some of the films.

The wow+flutter programme concentrates on "progressive motion graphics", which can include pretty much anything, while other parts of the festival are more specific: wavelength for music videos, j-star for japanese shorts etc. You can check out the entire list of w+f films are [here](http://www.onedotzero.com/programme.php?id=373&event=31216), but these are my favourites:

**Ubik: voxel**
I'm a fan of the augmented reality style when it's done well; and it certainly is here. Striking abstract graphics combine with a haunting location.


**Impactist: Parallelostory**
A beautifully subtle animation style with a 50's influenced colour and texture palette.

**Bruno Dicolla: Return as an Animal**
This featured a striking high-contrast rotoscoped style that looked great on the big screen. Unfortunately the shimmering starfield effect is a little lost in the on-line version. I could almost hear art directors reaching for their iPhones to jot down "must copy this at next available opportunity".


**Christian Schlaeffer: Agent Orange Ready**
A dark, disturbing animation in a comic style.




### The Lows


Ironically I found the most obviously "digital" films the most disappointing. There was a little too much in the Chris Cunningham inspired glitchy, razor-cut, super-shiny organic/mechanic vernacular. And there was also one film - which I won't name - that looked shockingly like a Tia Maria commercial. Still, in general the signal to noise ratio was very good.



### The Laughs


Some of the most memorable films are those with a punchline; the short film format is a great way of getting a laugh with a simple, funny idea. There's no risk of stretching it too thin.

**Mato Atom: Docking**
A laugh-out-loud concept executed nicely and succintly, and it even goes out with an anti-war punchline.


So there you are; just 5 of the 30+ shorts that were shown. If you're into animation or cutting-edge digital film-making, I'd recommend catching a onedotzero screening wherever you can, either in London or on one of the tour locations.
