I’m an experienced software developer and engineering manager currently working in a hedge fund in London.

I have previously spent over a decade in the quant team of an investment bank in London, working with a 15m line C++ codebase. and the .NET platform and languages including F#.

In my spare time I’ve developed and released several iOS games and applications.
